## About Great Place To Work

{{ page.description }}

## Executive Summary

> It all comes down to leadership. Maximizing human potential through leadership effectiveness is vital for businesses to thrive in this new For All business frontier.

The "Great Place to Work Hub" project is a groundbreaking initiative, which I helped spearheading the initiative to reimagine the future vision for Great Place to Work Hub.

The project aimed to create a comprehensive digital platform that mapped employees' demographic data with their Belonging sentiment, thereby improving Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts within the organization.

By focusing on leadership behavior and fostering a culture of empathy, the project sought to maximize human potential and drive business growth in the rapidly evolving "For All" business model.

## Business Value Proposition

The Great Place to Work Hub project was designed with the understanding that effective leadership is crucial to realizing the full potential of an organization's workforce.

The project was built on three core value propositions:

- **Improved leadership behavior** - By providing leaders with actionable insights into DEI and Belonging sentiment data, the platform enables them to make more informed decisions and foster a supportive and inclusive environment.

- **Enhanced employee engagement** - The project facilitates employee connection and collaboration, leading to increased satisfaction, productivity, and retention.

- **Strengthened company reputation** - Companies that embrace DEI initiatives and demonstrate commitment to employee well-being are more attractive to top talent and customers alike, creating a competitive advantage in the market.

## Design Process:

The project followed a comprehensive design process, which can be divided into four key stages:

### 1. Discovery

The first stage involved conducting extensive research on the current DEI landscape, understanding the organization's needs, and identifying opportunities for improvement. This included interviews with employees and leaders, focus groups, and surveys to gather qualitative and quantitative data.
