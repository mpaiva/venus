title: "The Power of Design: Avoiding Flashing Content to Protect Those with Epilepsy"
description: As designers, we have a profound responsibility to create safe and inclusive digital environments. One critical aspect of this is avoiding flashing content in our designs. While WCAG 2.3.1 allows for content that flashes under strict parameters, it is strongly recommended to refrain from using flashing elements altogether.

The young person depicted has their head tilted back, eyes closed, and mouth slightly open, conveying overwhelming sensation and loss of control. Electric blue lightning-like streaks emanate from their head, symbolizing the chaotic electrical activity in the brain during a seizure.

As we continue to innovate in the digital space, it's crucial to remember the impact our designs can have on all users. Specifically, let's focus on avoiding any flashing content in our designs, including slide presentations and videos, to ensure safety and inclusivity.

## Living with Epilepsy

<blockquote class="accent"> "Living with epilepsy means never knowing when normalcy will be interrupted by chaos."<br/> <span>- A friend living with epilepsy</span></blockquote>

People with epilepsy can experience a wide range of sensations and symptoms during seizures, and these experiences can vary greatly from person to person. Hereâ€™s a glimpse into what they might go through:

### General Sensations and Symptoms

**Aura:** Some individuals experience an aura before a seizure, which can include unusual feelings, sensations, or changes in perception. Common auras include:

- A sudden feeling of fear or anxiety
- A sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu
- Visual disturbances, such as flashing lights or hallucinations
- Strange smells or tastes
- A feeling of dizziness or lightheadedness

### During the Seizure

- **Loss of Consciousness**: Particularly in tonic-clonic seizures, the person may lose consciousness and collapse.
- **Muscle Stiffness and Jerking**: The body may become stiff (tonic phase) followed by rhythmic jerking movements (clonic phase).
- **Blank Stare**: In absence seizures, a person may suddenly stop what they are doing and have a blank stare.
- **Automatisms**: Some people may perform repetitive movements, such as lip-smacking, blinking, or hand movements, during focal seizures with impaired awareness.
- **Confusion**: Postictal confusion is common after a seizure, leaving the person disoriented and unable to communicate clearly.

### Emotional and Physical Impact

Living with epilepsy can have profound emotional and physical effects on individuals, affecting their daily lives and overall well-being.

- #### Fear and Anxiety

  - During a seizure, individuals may experience intense fear or anxiety.

- #### Exhaustion

  - Many people feel extremely tired and may need to rest or sleep after a seizure.

- #### Physical Injuries

  - There is a risk of injury during seizures, particularly if they occur while standing or performing activities that involve sharp objects or heights.

- #### Embarrassment and Social Stigma

  - The unpredictable nature of seizures can lead to feelings of embarrassment and concern about how others will react.

## Design Tips to Avoid Triggering Seizures

### Avoid Flashing Elements

- Refrain from using any flashing content in your designs. Even under strict WCAG parameters, it's best to avoid these elements altogether.

### Smooth Transitions

- In slide presentations, use smooth transitions instead of sudden changes between light and dark backgrounds.

### Static Content

- Prefer static content over animated or rapidly changing visuals.

### Video Warnings

- If videos must include flashing elements, add a clear notice before the video starts and provide an option for users to opt-out or skip the content.

### Color Choices

- Use colors and contrasts that are less likely to trigger visual disturbances. Avoid high contrast and bright, strobing patterns.

### Consistent Layouts

- Keep layouts consistent to minimize sudden visual changes that could startle or disorient users.

## Our Responsibility as Designers

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide two critical guidelines ([2.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold) and [2.3.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/three-flashes)) related to flashing content, which address the potential risks flashing content poses, particularly to individuals with photosensitive epilepsy.

<blockquote class="accent"> "While WCAG allows for content that flashes under very strict parameters, it is strongly suggested to refrain from using flashing content at all.</blockquote>

This recommendation is extended to content presented to public audience in large environements, such as:

- **Slide Presentations**: Avoid sudden slide changes between light and dark backgrounds.
- **Videos**: Refrain from including flashing elements.

**Note**: If there's a need to include such flashing elements, please add a notice before presenting and give users the option to opt-out. By avoiding flashing elements, we ensure that our designs are safe for everyone, especially those living with epilepsy.

## Letâ€™s Make a Difference

By adhering to these guidelines and prioritizing accessibility, we not only broaden our audience but also demonstrate empathy and responsibility as creators.

Together, we can ensure that our digital spaces are safe and inclusive for everyone. Let's create with care. ðŸ’™
