title: "The Power of Design: Avoiding Flashing Content to Protect Those with Epilepsy"
description: As designers, we have a profound responsibility to create safe and inclusive digital environments. One critical aspect of this is avoiding flashing content in our designs. While WCAG 2.3.1 allows for content that flashes under strict parameters, it is strongly recommended to refrain from using flashing elements altogether.

The young person depicted has their head tilted back, eyes closed, and mouth slightly open, conveying overwhelming sensation and loss of control. Electric blue lightning-like streaks emanate from their head, symbolizing the chaotic electrical activity in the brain during a seizure.
